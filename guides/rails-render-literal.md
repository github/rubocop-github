# Standard/RailsRenderLiteral

tldr; `render` MUST be passed a string literal template path.

* When used in conjunction with `Standard/RailsViewRenderPathsExist`, linters can ensure the target file exists on disk and would not crash rendering a missing template.
* Makes it easier for humans to trace callers of a template. Simply search for the full path of the target template to find **all** call sites.
* This same call site tracing enables automated unused template checking. If no callers are found, the template can be safely removed.
* Enables render precompilation and inlining optimizations. Target templates can be compiled and inlined on boot time rather than deferring to first render to lazily compile templates.
